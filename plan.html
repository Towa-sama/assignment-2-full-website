<h1>CP1406/CP1806/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Name: Assanali Amangeldiyev</h2>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of the website is to attract potential clients with beautiful pictures and pleasing background. There will also be the "buy" button in the middle of the home page so it will be easier for users to access the assortment of bakery. The menu page will show the price, information and facts about products where the specials page will provide sale opportunity in special days. In addition, about us section will contain the description, location and contact info of bakery. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To evaluate success the site need to provide statistics and in order to do that we will be making weekly surveys and every 3 months will count number of products sold. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The site wants to attract young generation from age of 17-35. That's why I will be using modern colors and backgrounds while not making it too toxic looking. It is also important to make website more simple for regular usage, so people will navigate easily through pages.</p>
